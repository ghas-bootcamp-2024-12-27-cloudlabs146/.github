ðŸ‘‹ Hey!  We're super glad you're here.  We've got a lot of stuff to do, so let's get started!

In this bootcamp session, we'll learn about the many facets of GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS).  We've broken this learning session down by modules.  Each component of GHAS is covered in a separate module.  By the end of this session, we'll cover:
- Code scanning and CodeQL
- Software supply chain security
- Secret scanning
- Administering and scaling GHAS

## How the environment works
GitHub works on a hierarchical structure. At the highest-level, you have an enterprise.  Within and enterprise, there are organizations (we call them orgs).  Within orgs, there are repos, which is where the source code is stored.  To make sure your experience during this bootcamp is as similar as possible to your real-world environment, we've provisioned a separate GitHub org for each student.  This org is all yours!  

Each of the learning modules are individual repositories within the org. Throughout the bootcamp session, we'll be navigating through the GitHub UI.  Want to learn a little more about how to use GitHub?  Check out the Intro to GitHub class on [skills.github.com](https://skills.github.com/).

## How do I get started?
Ah, aren't you an eager beaver ðŸ˜‰.  Typically, this is a classroom delivered learning experience.  Maybe you want to get started before your class?  Maybe you just have sneaky access to one of these orgs?  Either way, we're just glad you're here.  

Each of the repositories inside this org represent a different learning module.  Take some time going through each of the repos to see what kind of cool things you'll learn.  Maybe try starting with the `code-scanning` repo.

## Where can I find help?
The last thing we want is for you to feel left behind!  PLEASE ask your instructor if you have any questions throughout this session.  Most of us are are really nice and would prefer you to interrupt us with questions (except Keith, he's a huge jerk).
